Documentation of the Problem:

At its core, this program is a purposeful tool designed to simulate rainfall data for various cities within a specified timeframe. Leveraging Python's robust libraries—NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib—the primary objective isn't to navigate the intricacies of real-world meteorological challenges. Instead, it serves as a canvas to showcase fundamental programming concepts.

The data generated is intentionally fictitious, serving as an educational playground to nurture Python proficiency. The overarching goal is to illustrate the practical application of programming tools in basic data manipulation, intentionally steering clear of the complexities inherent in practical meteorological analyses.

Documentation of the Design:

Delving into the structural blueprint, the program is meticulously organized, placing a premium on modularity with distinct functions catering to specific tasks.

	generate_sample_rainfall_data: Acting as a virtual rain sculptor, this function meticulously crafts synthetic rainfall data. It achieves this by generating random numbers and arranging them in a city-day matrix, akin to building a structured spreadsheet capturing rainfall patterns for each city across defined days.
	calculate_average_rainfall: Serving as the computational engine, this function diligently calculates the average rainfall for each city. In simpler terms, it provides a straightforward summary of the dataset, answering the question, "On average, how much rain does each city experience?"
	write_result: This function assumes the role of a meticulous scribe, carefully transcribing the computed results into a CSV file. This file acts as a tangible repository, a documented record of the calculated average rainfall for future reference.
	plot_rainfall_data: Introducing a visual narrative, this function transforms data into a graphical representation. It illustrates how rainfall fluctuates across days for each city, adding a visual layer to aid in the comprehensive analysis of the dataset.

The main function, aptly named main, orchestrates these individual components, overseeing the orchestration of data generation, average computation, result archival, and visual representation.

The design philosophy is rooted in readability and reusability. Each function's name is a deliberate choice, conveying its purpose with clarity, and responsibilities are meticulously partitioned. Operating within the procedural paradigm, the code prioritizes straightforward comprehension and ease of modification. The integration of libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib aligns seamlessly with the pragmatic essence of the program.

In this expanded documentation, we've delved deeper into the program's purpose and design, providing a more nuanced perspective in line with the specified requirements.
